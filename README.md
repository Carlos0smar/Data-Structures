The objetive of this project is bild various data strutures types, learning on their behaivor and how to apply them.


# Assignments 

The following are assingments where I applied data strutres

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 20px;"> Tower of hanoi </summary>

<!-- ## Tower of hanoi -->
 On this assingment was applied the data struture stacks <br>

Delayed Submission Note: the date of the last comment was made one day after the date of submission, this was done to correct the way to implement it. I did it manually and it was modified so that it has the algorithm to reach the result by itself.

# Incremental Project

This project is a collection of data structures. <br>
You can run the project by running the main method in the `Main` class.

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 20px;"> Linked List </summary>

<!-- ## Linked List -->

This data structure is a collection of nodes, where each node has a reference to the next node in the list. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. The tail node has a reference to null.

<summary style="font-size: 20px;"> Stack </summary>

<!-- ## Stack -->

This data structure is a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

<summary style="font-size: 20px;"> Queues </summary>

<!-- ## Queue -->

This data structure is a collection of elements which follows FIFO method , with two main principal operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the collection, and dequeue, which removes the first added element that was not yet removed.

<summary style="font-size: 20px;"> Binary Search Tree </summary>

<!-- ## Binary Search Tree -->

This data structure is a collection of nodes, where each node has a reference to the left and right child. The left child is less than the parent node and the right child is greater than the parent node.

<summary style="font-size: 20px;"> Sorting Algorithms </summary>

<!-- ## Sorting Algorithms -->

### Merge Sort

This algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It is a comparison-based algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

- Route: Data-Structures/tree/main/src/main/java/cova/datastructures/mergesort
- Test cases: https://github.com/Carlos0smar/Data-Structures/blob/main/src/test/java/sortingtests/MergeSortTests.java

### Quick Sort

This algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by Tony Hoare in 1959. It is a comparison-based algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

- Test cases:https://github.com/Carlos0smar/Data-Structures/blob/main/src/test/java/sortingtests/QuickSortTests.java

### Bubble Sort

This algorithm is a comparison-based algorithm that compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
